# User system for Booosta PHP Framework

This modules provides a user system for the Booosta webapp module. It provides the possibility to create
users and admin users, administer them and let them log in.

Booosta allows to develop PHP web applications quick. It is mainly designed for small web applications.
It does not provide a strict MVC distinction. Although the MVC concepts influence the framework. Templates,
data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.

Up to version 3 Booosta was available at Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/booosta/ From version
4 on it resides on Github and is available from Packagist under booosta/booosta .

This is an early development version which cannot be used yet. Get Booosta 3 from Sourceforge or wait for
a usable version. Sorry, there will be no (easy) upgrade path from Booosta 3 to Booosta 4.
